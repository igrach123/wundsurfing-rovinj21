                <p>This course of two hours is conducted for those who want to try out the windsurfing. First steps in
windsurfing starts with a simulator, on the land, to explain and show our students how does windsurfing
work. After they try to start, move the sail and make a turn on the simulator, the funniest part on the
sea can start in our safe bay, just in front of the school! If the student decides to continue with 4 or 8
hours course, price of the course will be reduced by the price of test course.
